# LiveKit - Open source, distributed video/audio rooms over WebRTC

LiveKit is an open source project that provides scalable, multi-user conferencing over WebRTC. It's designed to give you
everything you need to build real time video/audio capabilities in your applications.

## Features

- Horizontally scalable WebRTC Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)
- Modern, full-featured [client SDKs](https://docs.livekit.io/references/client-sdks/) for JS, iOS, Android, and Flutter
- Built for production - JWT authentication and [server APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/guides/server-api)
- Robust networking & connectivity, over UDP & TCP
- Easy to deploy - pure Go & single binary
- Advanced features - speaker detection, simulcast, selective subscription, moderation APIs, and webhooks.

## Installing

### From source

Pre-requisites:

* Go 1.15+ is installed
* GOPATH/bin is in your PATH

Then run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/livekit/livekit-server
cd livekit-server
./bootstrap.sh
mage
```

### Docker

LiveKit is published to Docker Hub under [livekit/livekit-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)

## Running

### Creating API keys

LiveKit utilizes JWT based access tokens for authentication to all of its APIs. Because of this, the server needs a list
of valid API keys and secrets to validate the provided tokens. For more,
see [Access Tokens guide](https://docs.livekit.io/guides/access-tokens).

Generate API key/secret pairs with:

```shell
./bin/livekit-server generate-keys
```

or

```shell
docker run --rm livekit/livekit-server generate-keys
```

Store the generate keys in a YAML file like:

```yaml
APIwLeah7g4fuLYDYAJeaKsSE: 8nTlwISkb-63DPP7OH4e.nw.J44JjicvZDiz8J59EoQ+
```

### Starting the server

In development mode, LiveKit has no external dependencies. You can start LiveKit by passing it the keys it should use
in `LIVEKIT_KEYS`. LiveKit could also use a [config file](config-sample.yaml) or config environment
variable `LIVEKIT_CONFIG`

```shell
LIVEKIT_KEYS="<key>: <secret>" ./bin/livekit-server --dev
```

or

```shell
docker run --rm \
  -p 7880:7880 \
  -p 7881:7881 \
  -p 7882:7882/udp \
  -e LIVEKIT_KEYS="<key>: <secret>" \
  livekit/livekit-server \
  --dev \
  --node-ip=<machine-ip>
```

When running with docker, `--node-ip` needs to be set to your machine's IP address. If the service is to be exposed to
public internet, this should the machine's public IP.

The `--dev` flag turns on log verbosity to make it easier for local debugging/development

### Creating a JWT token

To create a join token for clients, livekit-server provides a convenient subcommand to create a **development** token.
This token has an expiration of a month, which is useful for development & testing, but not appropriate for production
use.

```shell
./bin/livekit-server --key-file <path/to/keyfile> create-join-token --room "myroom" --identity "myidentity"
```

### Sample client

To test your server, you can use our [example web client](https://example.livekit.io/)
(built with our [React component](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react))

Enter generated access token and you are connected to a room!

## Deploying for production

LiveKit is deployable to any environment that supports docker, including Kubernetes and Amazon ECS.

See deployment docs at https://docs.livekit.io/guides/deploy
